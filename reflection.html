<p><u>Responsive Design in Web Technologies</u>:- 
Responsive designing is all about display of web pages that is to make them look good. Responsive designing highly influences web technology. Nowadays, responsive designing is highly used by the web developers while making web applications. The use of HTML (Hyper-Text markup language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) to automatically resize, hide, minimize, or enlarge a website to make it seem excellent on all devices like desktops, phones, and etc is known as responsive web designing. There are several things that are done in responsive web design like setting the viewport, setting images to nicely fit in any type of browser like google chrome or Firefox, adjusting size of the text and many more things are done to make appropriate and good-looking web page or website. This is how all the websites that we open in our laptop and mobile conveniently adjust in both screen that big screen of laptop and small screen of phones. In other words, responsive design is responsible for creating convenient web applications for small screen and big screen devices. This proves that responsive designing plays a vital role in web technology. It is so because a good looking and nicely arranged web pages or websites are easier to read or look any other stuff in it. Moreover, it attracts users because users prefer well-arranged, attractive, and appealing web applications.</p> 
<p><u>Things I learned from my Research</u>:- 
From my research about building web apps for different device, I learned about responsive designing. I got to know how web developers create web applications as well as adjust each and everything so nicely and precisely for all the devices and web browsers. They make it possible by using different methods that are available in Responsive designing or I can say in Responsive web designing.  I also learned how web developers attract users. By using responsive designing, web developers make neat, clean, attractive, and appealing web applications, web developers attract users. </p>

<p><u>Learning Experience in the Course</u>: -
My course WEB222- Web Programming Principles was about web programming. In this course I learned three languages that are needed to design web applications and that are HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), JavaScript as well as CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). I really enjoyed this course because I got to learn three new languages. All three programming languages were very nice. Although I enjoyed learning all three languages but my favourite one is CSS because it makes the content look nice and colourful. All three languages are connected with each other because we need to learn all three to make web applications. My professor Mr. Tanvir Alam is a wonderful teacher. He taught me three web programming languages. He is supportive teacher and deliver excellent lectures. Also, he explains each and everything very nicely and precisely. I enjoyed his lecture. </p>
